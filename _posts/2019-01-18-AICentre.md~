The AI Centre carries out foundational research in AI. As we transition to a more automated society, the core aim of the Centre is to create new AI technologies and advise on the use of AI in science, industry and society. The Centre brings together researchers with a shared interest in fundamental challenges in Machine Vision, Machine Learning, Machine Reading, Machine Action, Interpretation and Knowledge Representation. The Centre takes inspiration from the vast array of applications across UCL and acts as the engine of methodological progress.
